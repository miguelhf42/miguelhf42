## Hi there! I'm Miguel ðŸ‘‹

I hold a degree in **Economics** from the Universidad de Valencia (UV) and a specialization in data analysis through a **Master's in Data Analytics for Business** at **EDEM** (School of Business, Management, and Leadership), where I discovered my true passion. ðŸš€

I am an active and organized person who never stops striving and working towards my goals until I achieve them. I enjoy tackling daily challenges, and I consider continuous growth and learning essential, both in the professional and personal realms. In the world of data, I advocate for the importance of teamwork, a way of working that I truly enjoy, as I consider myself a communicative and open individual who can learn something new from every person I work with.

My professional experience includes several months in a position within the banking sector, where I had the opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge of financial operations management, as well as develop skills in direct customer interaction.

I am ready to take the leap into the workforce, bringing my skills, energy, and ability to foster a positive work environment. I am excited to continue growing in a setting where I can contribute value and keep learning from those around me.
